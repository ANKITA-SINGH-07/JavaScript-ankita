/*For Loop
The for statement is a type of loop that will use up to three optional expressions to implement the repeated execution of a code block.

Syntax

for (initialization; condition; final expression) {
	// code to be executed
}
In the syntax above there are three expressions inside the for statement: the initialization, the condition, and the final expression, also known as incrementation.
*/
// Initialize a for statement with 5 iterations
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	// Print each iteration to the console
	console.log(i);
}
/* OUTPUT:-
0
1
2
3
*/

/*
 While Loop
In JavaScript, a while statement is a loop that executes as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.

The syntax is very similar to an if statement, as seen below.

while (condition) {
	// execute code as long as condition is true
}

*/

var x=0;
while(x<5)
	{
		console.log(x);
		x++;
	}

/* OUTPUT
0
1
2
3
4
*/


/*
 Doâ€¦While Loop
We already learned about the while loop, which executes a block of code for as long as a specified condition is true. Building on that is the do...while statement, which is very similar to while with the major difference being that a do...while loop will always execute once, even if the condition is never true.

Below we will demonstrate the syntax of the do...while loop.

do {
	// execute code
} while (condition)
*/

let f=3
do{
	f--;
	console.log(f);
}while(f>0)
